# PongGodot
PongGodot is a program written in C# using Godot 4.2

The program was created by integrating GitHub Desktop and Godot 4.2 with object-oriented programming.

This game was created with the intention of learning C# to get started in the world of video game programming, but learning to handle the basics of C# as best as possible before using the video game engine.

# Future Work

* I need to figure out later that the game detects that the player has lost, when the ball leaves the game area.
* Once the above is resolved, the score is recorded and the ball restarts in the center of the stage.
* Change the background of the Pongo board so that it doesn't look gray and is a little more eye-catching
